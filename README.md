# Java CRUD Application – Task Manager API
A robust backend application built with Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Maven, designed to demonstrate core principles of Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations through a RESTful API. This project reflects clean architecture practices, modular design, and integration with tools commonly used in real-world enterprise systems.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
Java 24 – Core programming language
Spring Boot – Simplifies application configuration and development
PostgreSQL – Relational database for persistent storage
Spring Data JPA – ORM layer for managing database operations
Postman – API testing and documentation
Maven – Dependency management and project build tool
IntelliJ IDEA – Primary development environment

## 📌 Key Features
RESTful API: Built with Spring MVC following REST principles
CRUD Functionality: Endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks
DTOs and Entity Mapping: Clean separation between persistence and presentation layers
Exception Handling: Centralized error management with custom exception classes
Validation: Input validation using Spring's @Valid and @NotNull

## 📂 Endpoints Overview
POST /api/tasks – Create a new task
GET /api/tasks – Retrieve all tasks
GET /api/tasks/{id} – Retrieve a specific task by ID
PUT /api/tasks/{id} – Update an existing task
DELETE /api/tasks/{id} – Delete a task

## 🦾 Maven Automation 
Build automation and project management tool used in Java development. It manages a project’s dependencies, builds, and documentation from a single configuration file called the POM (Project Object Model). Maven automatically downloads the libraries your project needs and handles the build lifecycle — making it easier for developers to maintain and share code across different environments.

## 📦 Docker Support
Includes a production-ready Dockerfile for containerizing the application and connecting it with a PostgreSQL instance via Docker Compose, enabling easy deployment and testing in isolated environments.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
Mastery of REST API design patterns using Spring Boot
Hands-on experience with database integration and persistence logic
Improved understanding of MVC architecture and layered backend development
Exposure to real-world deployment practices with containerization
